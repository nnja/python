### What is Python?

Python is a programming language created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s.

You might be surprised to learn that Python is 30 years old!

### Where is it used?

A common misconception is that Python is a scripting language. It's used at companies from Reddit, to Netflix, to Dropbox.

### What's all this about Python 2 vs Python 3

This part is a bit of a stain on Python's history. Python 3 was released 2008, and its adoption was slow. First and foremost because it took popular packages a fair amount of time to port over their code.

This debate is now over. Python 2 will reach end-of-life in 2020, meaning that important updates - including security updates - will stop being released. That's why this course focuses on *Python3 only*.

### Why Python?

Python the language is [open source](https://github.com/python/cpython).

Python has a wide variety of applications such as:

- AI/ML
    - SciPi
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - PyTorch
- Hardware & Micro-controllers
    - Raspberry Pi
    - MicroPython
    - CircuitPython
- Web Development
    - Django
    - Flask
- Scripting
    - DevOps
    Configuration scripts

Python has an incredibly rich fully featured [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), as well as the [PyPI Package Index](https://pypi.org/) for 3rd party packages, which as of February 2019 contains 167,107 packages.

Python is considered to be a "batteries included" language, because the standard library contains a majority of the libraries and packages you'll need in a standard application.


### Continuing In The Community

The absolute best part about Python is the incredibly supportive community.

The biggest yearly conference is [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org) with approximately 4000 attendees.

There are many local user groups worldwide, with many listed on [this wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups).

There are many supportive groups for women and non-binary developers, such as [PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/) and [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/). These organizations have chapters in most major cities.

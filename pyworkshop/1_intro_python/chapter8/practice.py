"""
TIP: Don't forget to run: pip install requests!

A small Python program that uses the GitHub search API to list
the top projects by language, based on stars.

GitHub Search API documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/search/

Additional parameters for searching repos can be found here:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-for-repositories#search-by-number-of-stars

Note: The API will return results found before a timeout occurs,
so results may not be the same across requests, even with the same query.

Requests to this endpoint are rate limited to 10 requests per
minute per IP address.

List comprehensions are a unique way to create lists in Python. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expressions can be any kind of Python object. List comprehensions will commonly take the form of `[<value> for <vars> in <iter>]`.

A simple case: Say we want to turn a list of strings into a list of string *lengths.* We could do this with a `for` loop:

```python
>>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [] # empty list
>>> for name in names:
...     my_list.append(len(name))
...
>>> print(my_list)
[4, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can do this much easier with a list comprehension:

```python
>>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [len(name) for name in names]
>>> print(my_list)
[4, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can also use comprehensions to perform operations, and the lists we assemble can be composed of any type of Python object. For example:

```python
>>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [("length", len(name) * 2) for name in names]
>>> print(my_list)
[('length', 8), ('length', 6), ('length', 8), ('length', 10)]
```

In the above example, we assemble a list of tuples - each tuple contains the element "length" as well as each number from the `len()` function multiplied by two.


### Conditionals

You can also use conditionals (`if` statements) in your list comprehensions. For example, to quickly make a list of only the even lengths, you could do:

```python
>>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [len(name) for name in names if len(name) % 2 == 0]
>>> print(my_list)
[4, 4]
```

Here, we divide every string length by 2, and check to see if the remainder is 0 (using the modulo operator).


### String Joining with a List Comprehension

Back in our exercise on converting between types, we introduced the `string.join()` function. You can call this function on any string, pass it a list, and it will spit out a string with every element from the list "joined" by the string. For example, to get a comma-delimited list of numbers, you might be tempted to do:

```python
>>> my_string = ",".join([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found
```

Unfortunately, you can't join a list of numbers without first converting them to strings. But you can do this easily with a list comprehension:

```python
>>> my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> my_string = ",".join([str(num) for num in my_list])
>>> print(my_string)
0,1,2,3,4
```


### `sum`, `min`, `max`

Some mathematical functions, such as `sum`, `min`, and `max`, accept lists of numbers to operate on. For example, to get the sum of numbers between zero and five, you could do:

```python
my_sum = sum([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
print(my_sum)
```

But remember, anywhere you can use a list, you can use a list comprehension. Say you want to get sum, minimum, and maximum of every number between 0 and 100 that is evenly divisible by 3? No sense typing out a whole list in advance, just use a comprehension:

```python
>>> my_sum = sum([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_sum)
1683
>>> my_min = min([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_min)
0
>>> my_max = max([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_max)
99
```
